Description: Standard multiple testing correction methods are not sufficient to
    directly handle datasets that contain a weaker background secondary signal 
    confounding the primary signal of interest. This package describes and 
    applies the bi-beta-uniform mixture (BBUM) model to adjust p-values. It 
    allows a modified estimation of false discovery rate (FDR) that takes into 
    consideration the secondary signal in the background that needs to be 
    excluded.
